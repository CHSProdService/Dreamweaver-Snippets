# WET4-Snippets for Dreamweaver CC
A collection of Dreamweaver CC code snippets to help with WET4 development.

To install these snippets for use, all you need to do is place the files inside the snippets folder for Dreamweaver.

The folder containing Dreamweaver CC 2015 code snippets can be found at the following path:

    C:\Users\xxxxx\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Dreamweaver CC 2015\en_US\Configuration\Snippets
    
To view snippets inside Dreamweaver go to **Window > Snippets** _or_ **Shift+F9**

To use a snippet in your code simply:

1. Select where you want your snippet to go (or what you want the snippet to wrap around).
2. Find the snippet you want to use in the snippet library.
3. Double click the snippet.


_We recommend adding this repository straight into the Dreamweaver snippets folder so that you can edit and create snippets for the repository inside Dreamweaver itself as one seamless process._
