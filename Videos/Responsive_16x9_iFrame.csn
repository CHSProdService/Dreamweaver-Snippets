Rules are directly applied to <iframe>, <embed>, <video>, and <object> elements; optionally use an explicit descendant class .embed-responsive-item when you want to match the styling for other attributes.

Pro-Tip! You don't need to include frameborder="0" in your <iframe>s as we override that for you." preview="code" type="block">
